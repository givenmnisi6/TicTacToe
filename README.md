# TicTacToe

## Board
I created a board (#), that looks like a hash


    _|_|_ (1st row)
    _|_|_ (2nd row)
     | |  (3rd row)

     
 ### Implementation
- The positions must be stored in an array - array of type character.
- There will be numbers 1 - 9 for the positions.

- 1st row
   number 1 will be in position [0,0] 
   number 2 will be in position [0,2]
   number 3 will be in position [0,4]

 - 2nd row
   number 4 will be in position [1,0] 
   number 5 will be in position [1,2]
   number 6 will be in position [1,4]

- 3rd row
  number 7 will be in position [2,0] 
   number 8 will be in position [2,2]
   number 9 will be in position [2,4]
