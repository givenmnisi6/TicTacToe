# TicTacToe

## Board
I created a board (#), that looks like a hash


    _|_|_ (1st row)
    _|_|_ (2nd row)
     | |  (3rd row)

     
 ### Implementation
- The positions must be stored in an array - array of type character.
- There will be numbers 1 - 9 for the positions.

1st row

number 1 - position [0,0] 
number 2 - position [0,2]
number 3 - position [0,4]

 2nd row

number 4 - position [1,0] 
number 5 - position [1,2]
number 6 - position [1,4]

3rd row

number 7 - position [2,0] 
number 8 - position [2,2]
number 9 - position [2,4]
