# TicTacToe

## Board
I created a board (#), that looks like a hash


    _|_|_ (1st row)
    _|_|_ (2nd row)
     | |  (3rd row)
     Something like that!
     
 ### Implementation
 so the must be positions in the array, we'll be using an array of character type
 so there will be more of numbers 1-9
