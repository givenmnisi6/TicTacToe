# TicTacToe

## Board
I created a board (#), that looks like a hash


    _|_|_ (1st row)
    _|_|_ (2nd row)
     | |  (3rd row)

     
 ### Implementation of Board
- The positions must be stored in an array - array of type character.
- There will be numbers 1 - 9 for the positions.

               1st Row                     2nd Row                     3rd Row                    
       number 1 - position [0,0] | number 4 - position [1,0] | number 7 - position [2,0] |
       number 2 - position [0,2] | number 5 - position [1,2] | number 8 - position [2,2] |
       number 3 - position [0,4] | number 6 - position [1,4] | number 9 - position [2,4] |
